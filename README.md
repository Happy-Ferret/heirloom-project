This is a mirror of The Heirloom Project's CVS repositories —
a collection of hisorical UNIX tools principally derived from
System V. Particularly noteworthy are its historical Bourne shell
and development/SCM tools — it includes some of the original
implementations of m4, lex, yacc, SCCS, troff, etc. Also included
here are the related original vi and 'nail' / mailx repositories.
